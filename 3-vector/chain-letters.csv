1924,"AN ANCIENT PRAYER
  Received January 29, 1924
  O Lord, be merciful to me. Let thy loving face shine on us. Let thy Brethren
 among all nations. Amen.
  This prayer was sent to me and it is to go around the world. It was [sent]
 in Jesus time and all who fail to send it on will meet with some misfortune.
 Copy and send to ten of your friends and see what happens to you on the
eleventh  day. Please do not break this chain. Sign no name, just the date
when received."
1925,"Dear Sir and Friend:
  In compliance with a request the following: 'God, I implore you to bless
 mankind and bring us to dwell with thee.''
  It is said that all who do not pass it on are in great danger of misfortune.
 Do good enough therefore to copy it and pass it on to nine others. On the
 tenth day some great joy will come to you. Do not break the chain but send
 it to nine brothers to whom you wish good luck. 
  This chain was started by an American army officer and should go around 
the world three times. Do not break the chain for whoever does will have bad
luck. Do it within twenty-four hours after you receive it."

 de Sedi. Make twenty copies and send them to friends, relatives and acquaintances.
  You will then receive good luck in the post, four days after

instructed his secretary to make twenty four (twenty) copies and send
them off. ""A few days later he won the lottery of two million dollars in
his country.""  Carlos Brandt (Carlos Branot), an office worker, received 
 the chain but forgot about it (lost it). He lost his job. He found
 the letter, sent out twenty four copies, and found a better job.
Good  luck comes four days later; the letter must be sent out in ninety-six 
hours.  A general in the Philippines received the letter and 
 $775,000 but died six days later because he failed to circulate 
 the chain. Zerin Berreskelli received the letter and threw it away. 
 Nine days later he died.  There is a plea that anyone who has received the letter 
 before to record good or bad luck from it on the copies they pass on.  The Prayer: ""Trust in the Lord with all your heart and
all will acknowledge that he will light the way."" The chain must make a tour
of the world. It has been around the world ten times.  The letter starts by saying it comes from Venezuela,

1975,"CHRISTMAS, 1975 Dear JOE 
YOU MAY NEVER BE THE SAME!! In your hands right now, you hold the Key
 to Universal Brotherhood and World Peace and Harmony! Use it! This is no
ordinary chain letter! Nobody loses! EVERYBODY WINS!  XSEND NO MONEY! By the time this one has worked x out,
 I won't NEED money! Neither will you! For untold Millennia, Mankind has
been  struggling towards the incredibly simple scheme I am currently revealing
to you FREE! XX Now, in this era of space-age communication (Xerox, Telstar,
 TV, etc.) and exponential increase, this struggle has at last been able
to  reach fruition! THIS IS THAT FRUIT! EAT OF IT!  HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: People have trouble with each
other, not because some of them are ""bad"" (nobody is all ""bad"" or all ""good"")
but because they are OUT OF ""SYNCH""*!! It's as simple as that! How many times
 have you done good to somebody, only to have evil returned to you? Once?
Twice? A thousand times?? After such experiences, you are far more likely
to do evil yourself. And, of course the person you treat badly will become
soured, too, in turn. And so on, in an ever-widening xxxo vicious circle.
X Jesus did his best to tackle the problem (return good for evil) but his
program was based on a mind-frame (be ye therefor perfect, even as thy father
in heaven is perfect) which most people find impossible to accomodate. However 
 IT IS NOW TIME TO REVERSE THE TREND. There is nobody so bad that he or she
 does not do good some of the time. If we could have ONE DAY IN WHICH EVERYBODY
 IN THE WORLD DOES NOTHING BUT GOOD --- imagine the consequences! Imagine
how GOOD everybody will feel! After such an xxxx experiance, NOBODY will
want to go back to the old, confused, hateful way of operating!!!!
 BUT HOW COULD SUCH A DAY COME TO PASS? Do you think
 you could return good for evil one day out of every 14? SURE YOU COULD!!
So could anybody! Remember-- it doesn't matter how lowdown, absently cruel,
vindictive, malicious, or ruthless you may be on the other 13 xxx days--
just for that one day, do good, do good, do good good good, xxxxx no matter
what is done in return. Scientific tests have shown such a program to be
well within the limits of human interactional psychology.  SO WHAT? So do two things. First, send a copy of this
 letter to twenty trusty friends. (They, incidentally, will be pleased to
know that you consider them trusty.) Second, starting traditionally with
Christmas Day, and in every second Thursday thereafter, follow the simple
plan outlined in the above  paragraph. Do good. Be happy. Do this for only one
year.  THE LOAVES AND THE FISHES. The first Good Thursday
after Christmas will be observed by 400 ""good;"" people. Not so many, maybe--
but wait! Next Good Thursday will find 8000 practitioners! Not bad! Next,
160,000! Next, 3,200,000! That's bigger than most cities! Next, 64,000,00!
Next, 1,280,000,000! That''s almost twice the population of the USA!!!!!

 BUT, OF COURSE, these are ""ideal' figures. A few shortsighted
 people (NOT YOU!) will doubtless throw their letters into their wastebaskets
 and try to forget the whole thing. But-- the immutable laws of Statistical 
 Distribution ensure that xx every person on earth will get not one-- not 
two- but several-- hundreds-- THOUSANDS of copies of this letter! These letters,
 taken with the implacable M GOODNESS of the people with whom the must deal
 every second Thursday will serve to convince-- nay, positively coerce--
the  most hardened of skeptics. Consider-- and I don't blame you if you refuse
 to believe this at first, but I do urge you most strongly to WORK IT OUT
FOR YOURSELF-- the ironclad science of Mathematics demonstrates conclusively
that on the last Good Thursday before Christmas 1976-- GOOD CHRISTMAS-- x
 882, 922,240,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
 copies of this letter will be in the mails. The margin
 for error is such that this scheme may be considered positively and unmistakably 
 INFALLABLE!! IT CANNOT FAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE? Counting stamps, envelopes,
 and copying, you might spend as much as $5.00. Even if (as impossible as
the above figures demonstrate such an hypothesis to be) the program
is incompletely successful-- xxx still, you will have participated in the
Noblest Struggle of All Time-- perhaps helped found a truly Holy City or
even Nation-- and, at the very least, practiced a valuable and timehonored
spiritual discipline, which can do you nothing but good, and which requires
only a modicum of effort on your part.  ISN'T IT WORTH IT? Think of it! The Kingdom of Heaven
 on Earth! Everybody Good, All the Time!! The Lion Lies on the Lamb! The
End  of Starvation and Injustice! Holy Socialism! Don'T Delay! Don't Break

 FOR NO REASON SHOULD THIS CHAIN BE BROKEN!!!!!  Col Tom Parker recieved this chain in 1953, and asked
 his valet to make 24 copies and send them along with a bill of services
rendered.  One week later he discovered Elvis and Olive Davis. A record executive
recieved  the chain and lost it among his Bar Mitzvah bills. Five days later
his office  was dismantled. He found the chain while writing his novel, sent
out fifty  copies and got a better job and a suspended sentence. Pamela Pelland
recieved  the chain but was too busy meditating. Five days later her record
was released.  Richard Neely recieved the letter and was asked to revise
the remixing of  a top Disco hit. He found the PAST DUE chain in a script
and never got credit  on the album. Twenty copies later, he bought the script.
Neil Bogart recieved  it, sent out twenty copies in unstamped envelopes and
the very next week sat down on a piece of discarded bublegum. David Geffen
recieved the chain by opening someone elses mail and faithfully followed
the instructions to a ""T"" and was rewarded a promotion from mail boy to mail
secretary. He recieved the chain again in '74, this time he was too busy
to bother with  it. Five days later he met Irving Azoff. Helen Reddy recieved
the chain but  could only afford to send out ten copies. The next week she
met Jeff Vale  ... you figure it out. Roger Steffens apologizes for the banality,
has no  idea whether this is for 'real' and is too chickenshit to break the
chain.  Because I love and trust Bryan, and because, what the hell,it can't
hurt,  Big Mac sends it on. See ski see. Two years PAST DUE he sends it to
you. (Anybody need a mail secretary?)  STEEVE LEEDS

1988,"Are you stressed out?  Read on! Do you know who, in 1923, was:     1. President of the largest steel
company? 
   2. President of the largest gas company? 
   3. President of the New York Stock Exchange?

   4. The greatest wheat speculator? 
   5. President of the Bank of International Settlement?

   6. The great Bear of Wall Street?  These men should be considered some of the world's
 most successful men, 
as least they found the secret of making money.  Now more than
 65 years 
later, do you know what became of these men?     1. The president of the largest steel
 company, Schwab, died a pauper. 
   2. The president of the largest gas company, Howard 
Hopson, is 
      insane. 
   3. The president of the New York Stock Exchange, Richard
 Whitney, was 
      released from prison to die at home.

   4. The greatest wheat speculator, Arthur Cooper, died
 abroad, 
      insolvent. 
   5. The president of the Bank of International Settlement 
 shot 
      himself. 
   6. The great Bear of Wall Street, Mr. C. Riverhore, 
committed 
      suicide.  That same year, 1923, the winner of the most important
 golf 
championship, Gene Sarasen, won the U.S. Open and PGA Tournament.  
 Today 
he is still playing and he's solvent.  Conclusion: 
Conclusion:      Stop worrying
 about business and play golf!!!! 
Conclusion:  This letter originated
 in the Netherlands, and has been passed around 
the world at lest 20 times, bringing good luck to everyone who passed

it on.  The one who breaks the chain will have bad luck.  
 Do not keep 
this letter.  Do not send money.  Just have a wonderful, 
 efficient 
secretary make four additional copies and sent it to five of your

friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will see that something
 good 
happens to you four days from now if this chain is not broken.

this to 7 
people, no boys. Within 5 days this task must be completed. On 
the 5th day drink 5 glasses of water and say your crush's name 
or the name of some one you love very much. By the 11th day your

crush will ask you out or say ""I [heart sign] U."" This game has 
been 
played since 1887. It has worked for many people for many years.
